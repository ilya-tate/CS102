SASS 101:
    - SASS is exactly like what we have been doing in CSS but better.
    - We are able to nest styles, define variables easier and do inline caclculations easier.

    Creating .scss Files
        - Sass is just a type of scss but it is the most commonly used one and you are able to use both style.scss and style.sass.
        - Almost everyone uses SCSS and we are too but if you are working alone don't be afraid to try it out.

    Compiling SCSS
        - Websites can't run on scss so we will need to compile it down to a css file in order to use it on the HTML
        - We are going ot download an extension to do this.

    Variables
        - You could make variables before but they were kind of annoying and you needed to create them in root.
        - Now you cna make them anywhere isng the dollar sign.
        Ex.
        $main-color: lightblue;
        $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
        $border-color: #333;

    Nesting
        - We no longer have to declare each and every element on the way too the one that we want to edit.
        - We can use nesting to refer tochild elements (just like every other coding language) and the scss will compile into the proper references.
    
    Nesting Similar Properties
        - Some properites are very similar to one another for examples padding-left, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-top.
        - SCSS can group these through nesting, making it easier for us.
        Ex.
        padding: {
            top: 5px;
            right: 0px;
            left: 50px;
        }

    & with Pseudo Classes
        - Creating pseudo classed (:active, :focus, :hover, etc.) is also made easeir by using the front of the pseudo class that you want to add.
        Ex.
        .button {
            &visited {
                background {
                    background-color: red;
                }
                &:hover {
                    background-color: yellow;
                }
                &:active {
                    background-color: green;
                }
            }

    Maps
        - We can create maps similar to objects in js except with parenthesis.
        - They are set up with an object name and then corresponding key: value pairs.
        Ex.
        $font-weight {
            'small': 300,
            'medium': 500,
            'large: 700,
        };

    map-get
        - Using these can be a little tedious but it is still good practice to get used to these for larger sites.
        - To use these maps you need to use the mao-get method in your scss.
        Ex.
        font: map-get($font-weight, small);
        font: map-get($map: $font-weight, $key: small);

    Functions
        - That map-get is kinda clunky and can get really annoying to use so most scss coders will use functions to fix that.
        - To create a function in scss you use the @ function rule.
        Ex.
        @function weight($name) {
            @return map-get($font-weight, $name);
        };
        div {
            font: weight(bold);
        }

    Mixins
        - These are kind of like partials but theya re used in line and not in another file.
        - You create a mixin using the @mixin rule and then you can call it by using @include rule.

    Common Mixins
        - There are many bits of code that we need to type too often, for example for example do to flex we need to do:
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        flex-direction: row;
        - Mixins help with this because they allow us to write it one time and then @include it as many times as we want.
        Ex.
        @mixin flexCenter($direction) {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            flex-direction: $direction;
        }
        @include flexCenter(row);

    Dark Theme Mixin
        - This is for coding only and will not update live on the page but here is an example of a mixin.
        Ex.
        @mixin theme($dark-theme: true) {
            @if $dark-theme {
                background: darken($main-color, 100%);
                color: lighten($text-color, 100%);
            }
        }
        .dark {
            @include theme(true);
        }

    Caclculations
        - We are able to use calc() in css but in scss you can just do calculations without a method.
        Ex.
        width: 50% - 4% // 46%

    Extending Container
        - If you want 2 things t ohave all the smae properties as each other you can use the @extend rule and it will clone all of the same css properties, then you can modify what you want after it.
        Ex.
        #submit {
            @extend #testing;
            &:hover{background-color: black;}
        }


jQuery 101
- jQuery is a javascript library that allows us to navigate the DOM and implement animations adn events easier then base JS.
- jQuery is used very often and by thousands of companies

    Proper Installing jQuery
        - jQuery is not like SASS, it cannot be installed globally and still be expected to work.
        - Sinec javascript is a library that is being executed on the client side when the page runs it won't be able to run the site if it doesn't have jQuery installed.
    CDN
        - In order to get these libraries out to everyone that needs it, we use a system called a CDN or Content Delivery Network.
        - This is a simple way to import your library with a link and then it is downloaded on the user's computer when they enter the site.
    Finding the CDN
        - In case you didn't find it look up jQuery CDN on google and it's the first link.
    The jQuery Structure
        - jQuery is written very similar to js with a few key differences. They use $(); to grab values and then .methods to act on it.
        Ex.
        $(document).ready();
    Container for jQuery
        - Before you code any jQuery you need to wrap it in a container that will make sure the html is loaded.
        Ex.
        $(document).ready(function () {
            // Code
        });
    Shorthand
        - This is done at the beginning of ever jQuery so coders got tired oftyping and now ther is shortand for it.
        Ex.
        $(function () {});
    Using jQuery
        - Here is an example of code that will hide a panel. I'll explain it a little more on the next slide.
        Ex.
        $(function()) {
            $(#panel1).hide(1000);
        }
        - We access the panel using the id just like css but with a $().
        - This .hide is a jQuery method and (1000) a how long it will take to do this action in milliseconds.
    Chaining
        - EVERYTHING in jQuery is done using methods like .hide.
        - Because of this we can chain together many methods in row as we want.
        Ex.
        $('#panel1').hide(1000).show(1000).hide(1000);
    Toggling
        - Commmands like show and hide will only work in one collection, meaning if it is already hidden it won't show.
        - This means you will need a button to show and another button to hide.
        - This is fixed by the addition of toggle.
        - Almost every action in jQuery has a toggle ability.
        - If it is hidden then it will show and vise versa.
        Ex.
        $('#panel1').toggle(1000);

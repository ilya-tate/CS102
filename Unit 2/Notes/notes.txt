SASS 101
    - SASS is exactly like what we have been doing in CSS but better.
    - We are able to nest styles, define variables easier and do inline caclculations easier.


    Creating .scss Files
        - Sass is just a type of scss but it is the most commonly used one and you are able to use both style.scss and style.sass.
        - Almost everyone uses SCSS and we are too but if you are working alone don't be afraid to try it out.

    Compiling SCSS
        - Websites can't run on scss so we will need to compile it down to a css file in order to use it on the HTML
        - We are going ot download an extension to do this.

    Variables
        - You could make variables before but they were kind of annoying and you needed to create them in root.
        - Now you cna make them anywhere isng the dollar sign.
        Ex.
        $main-color: lightblue;
        $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
        $border-color: #333;

    Nesting
        - We no longer have to declare each and every element on the way too the one that we want to edit.
        - We can use nesting to refer tochild elements (just like every other coding language) and the scss will compile into the proper references.
    
    Nesting Similar Properties
        - Some properites are very similar to one another for examples padding-left, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-top.
        - SCSS can group these through nesting, making it easier for us.
        Ex.
        padding: {
            top: 5px;
            right: 0px;
            left: 50px;
        }

    & with Pseudo Classes
        - Creating pseudo classed (:active, :focus, :hover, etc.) is also made easeir by using the front of the pseudo class that you want to add.
        Ex.
        .button {
            &visited {
                background {
                    background-color: red;
                }
                &:hover {
                    background-color: yellow;
                }
                &:active {
                    background-color: green;
                }
            }
        }
